# Expo Camera Black Screen on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the camera preview fails to display on certain Android devices after the app is backgrounded or the device is restarted. The preview shows a black screen instead of the expected camera feed. The issue is not consistently reproducible.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo start`.
3. Open the app on an Android device.
4. Minimize the app or restart the device.
5. Reopen the app.  The camera preview may appear as a black screen.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

The root cause is likely related to how Expo manages camera resources and lifecycle events on Android.  The solution proposed involves more robust error handling and camera initialization, which may prevent the issue.
